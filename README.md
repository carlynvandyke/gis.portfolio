Here's my portfolio for Advanced GIS.

# About me

My name is Carlyn, and I'm a second year master's student studying Health Care Policy and Management. My bachelor's degree is in Community Health, and I worked in health care for several years prior to coming to Heinz. So, I guess I'm pretty into health.

I'm originally from the DC area (the Maryland side of the suburbs) but have lived in Pittsburgh for three years. My then-boyfriend, now-husband and I moved here hoping to have an adventure in a new city (but still close enough to home). We bought a strange old house and adopted a strange young dog, Cricket.

I'm interested in health equity- that is, eliminating unjust disparities in health access and outcomes that are created by social or structural determinants. I don't know what I'll be doing after graduation, but as I job search, my main focus is finding something that will contribute some good to the world

# What I hope to learn

I love GIS because it sits at the intersection of a lot of things I care about. As with everyone at Heinz, I'm interested in using data to solve problems, and I think that the insights GIS provides are particularly relevant for health (shoutout to John Snow). But I also am passionate about art and design- particularly color. So being able to fiddle around with data and come up answers to important questions, AND make it look good, is right up my alley.

Having said that, I would say my main goal for Advanced GIS class is to practice what I learned last year in Health GIS so that I can feel like I have those skills mastered, and could use them in the real world- but I am also excited to learn about different mapping and map-related technologies. I am stoked to put together a portfolio of work to take with me when I graduate.

# Portfolio

Here is a placeholder for my portfolio, which I will fill out during this minimester. A couple examples of work include:

* [My Google Map Custom Style](https://carlynvandyke.github.io/gis.portfolio/kaballamap.html), inspired by [this painting](https://africa.si.edu/collections/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:14379) by Congolese artist Sylvestre Kaballa. I found the painting in through the [Smithsonian Open Access](https://www.si.edu/openaccess) initiative.
* [A short story map I made](https://arcg.is/1KT1SP) in a previous class which addresses health insurance coverage and payday loan companies in my homeland of Prince George's County, MD.
