# About me

My name is Carlyn, and I'm a second year master's student studying Health Care Policy and Management. My bachelor's degree is in Community Health, and I worked in health care for several years prior to coming to Heinz. So, I guess I'm pretty into health.

I'm originally from the DC area (the Maryland side of the suburbs) but have lived in Pittsburgh for three years. My then-boyfriend, now-husband and I moved here hoping to have an adventure in a new city (but still close enough to home). We bought a strange old house and adopted a strange young dog, Cricket.
